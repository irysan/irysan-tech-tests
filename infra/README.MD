# Infrastructure Interview Tech Task

## Context

In the final stage of our interview process we want to discover how you handle infrastructure day-to-day.
We will not do whiteboarding or live coding tasks in the interview, instead we ask you to complete the following task in your own time and talk us through your approach during the interview.

This is not a pass or fail, it is a starting point for discussion led by you.

We appreciate that your time is valuable, which is why weâ€™ve designed this exercise to be completed in around 1-2 hours and keep the invterview rounds as lean as possible. If you cannot spare the time, you may want to consider option 2.


### Things we want to see

- An ability to handle code like a software engineer
- Maintainability of solutions
- Containers
- Infrastructure as Code
- Monitoring
- Consideration of CI/CD
- Resilience
- Ability to develop applications locally in a consistent environment
- Concise documentation (please include a README)

We are only interested in the code, you **do not** need to leave your project running and should not incur any aws costs in order to complete this.

## Option 1

Create a simple 'Hello World' web application (for example, python or node.js) and deploy it to a Cloud Infrastructure, such as an AWS account, using appropriate tools and best practices.

You are expected to demonstrate containerisation, pipelines and a minimal orchestration setup of your choice.  When deployed, the root url should display 'Hello World'.


## Option 2

If you have some personal code that you would be prepared to share with us, we can assess that instead.  The code should meet the following criteria:

- It should be your own work.
- Ideally, it should involve an element of web development platform
- It should demonstrate how you approach any particular problem
- It should be something that you are able to discuss with us
- It should cover most of the points that we are looking for in option 1

## Submission

- **Please submit everything as a github repo** - send the details to your point of contact.
- Please include a README containing any relevant information.
- You will be expected to screen share and walk us through your submission during the interview.
